				Then, you start talking about some interesting stuff that nobody wants to read<br /><br />
				Then you can quote someone to add credibility:
			</p>
			<blockquote>
				A quotation is a handy thing to have about, saving one the trouble <br />
				of thinking for oneself, always a laborious business <br /><br />
				- A.A. Milne, If I May
			</blockquote>
			<p>
				Finally you can have some bullets to summarize everything, after all, new <br />
				generations have this things in common:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Don't like to read long texts.</li>
				<li>Have the spawn of attention of a bird.</li>
				<li>Skip long paragraphs straight to the bullet points.</li>
			</ul>
